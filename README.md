## Introduction

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms. This guide covers fundamental concepts in C++ through practical examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with C++, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC, Clang, or any other compiler of your choice. Additionally, you may want to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion to streamline your development process.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- An IDE or text editor (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Install a C++ Compiler**:
   - **Windows**: Install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or use the compiler included with Visual Studio.
   - **Linux**: Install GCC via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install g++` for Ubuntu).
   - **Mac**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

2. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-projects.git
   cd cpp-projects
